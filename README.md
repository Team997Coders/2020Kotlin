# 2020 Kotlin Robot Repo
997 Spartan Robotics' kotlin repository for our 2020 FRC robot

On a bet (our standard Milk Shake bets), I asked Hunter to take our current robot code that was nominally functional and after he had said he needed a new challenge and that we should try Kotlin some time, I had him re-create our code in Kotlin.  He won that beg (marginally) by delivering this code the next day.  While is does function and is a great basis for the team going forward, it still needs work (as expected).

Great job Hunter.
